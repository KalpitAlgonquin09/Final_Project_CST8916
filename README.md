# Assignment #1: Stock Market Simulation with REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket

## Objective
The objective of this assignment was to develop a stock market simulation application that allows users to fetch stock prices, observe real-time price changes, and compare the efficacy of REST API, GraphQL, and WebSocket in delivering this data.

### 1. Stock Data Entry and Retrieval using REST API
- Developed a REST API to allow for the addition of new stocks (name, ticker symbol, current price).
- Implemented functionality for users to fetch a list of all stocks and their current prices using the same API.

### 2. Fetching Specific Stock Details using GraphQL
- Implemented a GraphQL schema and resolvers to fetch detailed data for a particular stock, including historical price data, highest and lowest prices, and trading volume.
- Provided a UI allowing users to send a query to select a specific stock and retrieve its detailed data using GraphQL.

### 3. Real-time Stock Price Updates using WebSocket
- Implemented WebSocket functionality to send real-time updates of stock price changes to connected clients.
- Displayed a live updating chart or list showing stock prices updating in real-time.

### 4. Performance and Benefits Analysis
- Compared the efficiency, speed, and benefits of using WebSocket versus traditional request-response methods (REST and GraphQL) for this application.
- Wrote a brief report detailing the findings of the analysis.

### 5. Documentation
- Clearly documented the setup, execution process, and any assumptions made during the development.
